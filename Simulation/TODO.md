# Assignment 3

# Memory: 
- Almost finished. Just a few errors.
- Implement i port and D port.
- Everything needs events
- Implement what each register, data memory, and instruction memory holds

A tab in the s file signifies an immediate value instruction
.LBB0 is a branch

Stager the pipeline operations.
Cpu triggers the pipeline on an odd clock cycle and on an event 
And on an even cycle the release event is called and passes the data to the next stage

Rising edge is odd cycle and even is falling edge. Implement this for all events

If execute is still processing reshcedule release event for a future data and process stall

Dynamic cast will allow an event to be casted back to its original class from a base event. Example: Event back to Fetch 

Hi  referes to the top 20 bits of memory address
Low referes to the bottom 12 bits of memeory address

Donâ€™t have to convert the asm to binary in the code but can do it by hand and insert into memory locations.

# Flow
- Convert the instructions into binary and place them into instruction memory. This is done in the setup simulation function.
- Add registers and other variable to hold an instruction in pipeline.
    - Store stage only needs the destination register.
    - Fetch just needs a variable to hold the instruction
    - Decode breaks up the instruction and passes it to the execute
- All the stages are done using a send and receive events 
    - Receive is triggered by the cpu when a stage needs to be run. This already done. Done on odd cycles
    - Send is created when the stage is completed and needs to pass its data. To the next stage This is done on an even cycle
- Stalls need to be implemented
