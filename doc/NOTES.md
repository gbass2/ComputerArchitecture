# Assignment 3

# Memory:
- Almost finished.
- Implement what each register, data memory, and instruction memory holds.
- Registers need to be setup with their proper functions. For example X0 is the zero register and always contains zero.

# Flow
- Convert the instructions into binary and place them into instruction memory. This is done in the setup simulation function.
- Add registers and other variable to hold an instruction in pipeline.
    - Store stage only needs the destination register.
    - Fetch just needs a variable to hold the instruction.
    - Decode breaks up the instruction and passes it to the execute.
- All the stages are done using a send and receive events.
    - Receive is triggered by the cpu when a stage needs to be run. This already done. Done on odd cycles.
    - Send is created when the stage is completed and needs to pass its data. To the next stage This is done on an even cycle.
- Stalls need to be implemented for the execution stage.

# Notes:
- A tab in the s file signifies an immediate value instruction
- .LBB0 is a branch
- Stager the pipeline operations.
- Cpu triggers the pipeline on an odd clock cycle and on an event.
- And on an even cycle the release event is called and passes the data to the next stage.
- Rising edge is odd cycle and even is falling edge. Implement this for all events.
- If execute is still processing reschedule release event for a future data and process stall.
- Dynamic cast will allow an event to be casted back to its original class from a base event. Example: Event back to Fetch.
- Hi  referes to the top 20 bits of memory address.
- Low referes to the bottom 12 bits of memory address.
- Donâ€™t have to convert the asm to binary in the code but can do it by hand and insert into memory locations.
- Adding pthread should allow us to multithread some operations. Not sure if we are allowed to use this since it taps into the cpus threads.
- NOPs may be required while waiting for data to load from RAM, stalls may be required while waiting for data to store in RAM) [15]
- For rounding mode for fadd.s we chose 111 (dynamic rounding mode (see page 48 of riscv spec))

# Example:
Ticks:
0 - setup simulation
1  - run first fetch stage
6 - send data to decode stage from fetch
11 - run decode and next fetch stage
12 - access the registers and place into decode
16 -  pass decode to execute and fetch to decode
21 - run execute, decode, fetch.
26  - If execute is done, then pass to store, pass decode to execute, and fetch to decode.

# Questions
- Figure out Stalls
- Need to figure out how we are going to deal with memory access.
    - When in fetch stage We are accessing memory but without creating an instruction memory access event.
        - create an event and put it at the top of meq. we return from the fetchInstruction function run the instruction access event and then go back to fetch. Figure out how to do the efficiently.
        - Do we do this 4 times. Each for the 4 different memory locations that the instruction is stored in or do we do this once for all 4 locations.

# Still need
- Part 1
    - Add the instructions to the instruction memory.
    - Finish the pipeline data flow
        - Figure out how to handle the Memory Access events
        - Implement stalls and nops to handle hazards and latencies
        - Implement the alu operations
    - Convert to C

- Part 2
    - Implement Membus
